    <h1>Early CIA, SSU and OSS Files</h1>
    
    <p>From the 1960s through the 1990s, the U.S. Government 
declassified the majority of its security-classified records relating to
 World War II. Yet, 60 years after the war, millions of pages of wartime
 and postwar records remained classified.  Many of these records 
contained information related to war crimes and war criminals. This 
information had been sought over the years by congress, government 
prosecutors, historians and victims of war crimes. These records include
 operational files that sheds important historical light on the 
Holocaust and other war crimes, as well as the U.S. Government’s 
involvement with war criminals during the Cold War. The majority of 
these records were declassified by the Nazi War Crimes and Japanese 
Imperial Government Records Interagency Working Group. These files have 
been released through the Freedom of Information Act and published 
individually in CIA's reading room. The files have been gathered and 
organized by subject for easy viewing and research.</p>
    
    <p>Descriptions come from the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/iwg/declassified-records/rg-263-cia-records/second-release-lexicon.pdf">Cryptonyms and Terms in Declassified CIA Files</a>
 research aid and Wikipedia. An error from individually transferring the
 files from their disorganized state on the CIA website has caused the 
occassional file to be dropped while being uploaded, and may cause a 
discrepancy between the total files and the files available on

covert contacts, many from the legal profession and/or East German 
government. The UfJ, with CIA assistance, conducted extensive propaganda
 campaigns in East Germany, based mainly on information from East German
 informants, to expose illegal actions, breaches of justice, and acts of
 inhumanity committed and tolerated by authorities in East Germany. An 
outgrowth of the UfJ-sponsored International Congress of Jurists in 
Berlin (1952) was the establishment of the International Commission of 
Jurists in The Hague, which was supported by CIA under Project

KMMANLY (1951-53) was originally designed to counter the actions of 
pacifist and neutralist groups in West Germany who were opposed to 
ratification of the contractual agreements. In practice KMMANLY sought 
to win support for the European Defense Community (EDC) in areas of 
veterans' affairs and military publishing. To achieve these aims, three 
publications were utilized under KMMANLY -- Die Deutsche Soldaten 
Zeitung (The German Soldiers' Newspaper, (DSZ)), Europaische 
Wehrkorrespondenz (European Defense Newsletter, (EWK)), Wehr 
Wissenschaftliche Rundschau (Military Science Journal, (WWR)). In 
addition KMMANLY supported the Gesellschaft fuer Wehrkunde (GfW), a 
military science study group composed of former high ranking German Army
 officers. Wilhelm Classen (PA), Eberhard Von Nostitz, Burghard Von 
Preussen, Felix Steiner associated with GfW part of Project. Josef 
Berschneider, Hans Iglhaut, Werner Strecker considered for possible use 
on KMMANLY. </p>
